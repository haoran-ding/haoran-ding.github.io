I am Haoran Ding, a final year Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen) at SJTU, [Prof. Zhong Shao](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/shao/) at Yale University, and [Prof. Zhaoguo Wang](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/zhaoguo_wang) at SJTU. I am also very lucky to work with [Prof. Jinyang Li](https://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/) at New York University and [Prof. Ruzica Piskac](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/) at Yale University.

My research focuses on the intersection of formal verification and systems software, aiming to develop practical theories and tools that can enhance both system correctness and performance.
